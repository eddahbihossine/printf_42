# 📊 ft_printf

## Overview

Welcome to **ft_printf**! 🎉 This project is part of the 42 curriculum, where you will implement your own version of the C standard library function `printf`. By doing this, you'll gain a deeper understanding of variadic functions, formatted output, and string manipulation in C. 🛠️

## 🚀 Features

- **Basic Conversion Specifiers:** Supports `%c`, `%s`, `%p`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, and `%X`.
- **Bonus Features:** Add support for additional flags like `#`, `0`, `-`, ` ` (space), and `+`.
- **Memory Management:** Proper handling of memory allocation and freeing for dynamic strings.

## 🛠️ Function Prototype

```c
int ft_printf(const char *format, ...);
```

- **`format`:** The string containing the text to be written to the standard output, optionally containing format specifiers that are replaced by the values of additional arguments.

### Example Usage

```c
ft_printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
ft_printf("Number: %d, Hex: %x\n", 42, 42);
```

## 📋 Project Structure

```plaintext
|-- srcs/
|   |-- ft_printf.c           # Main ft_printf logic
|   |-- ft_printf.h           # Header file with prototypes and macros
|   |-- ft_putchar_n_count.c  # Helper function to print a character and count it
|   |-- ft_putstr_n_count.c   # Helper function to print a string and count it
|   |-- ft_putnbr_n_count.c   # Helper function to print a number and count it
|   |-- ft_puthexa_n_count.c  # Helper function to print a hexadecimal number and count it
|   |-- ft_putptr_n_count.c   # Helper function to print a pointer address and count it
|-- Makefile                  # Makefile to compile the project
|-- main.c                    # Test file for ft_printf implementation
```

## 🧪 Testing

To compile and test your `ft_printf` function, use the provided Makefile:

```bash
make
./ft_printf
```

You can also create your own test cases in `main.c` to verify the behavior of your implementation against the standard `printf` function.

## 🧩 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
- Gain a deep understanding of how formatted output functions work in C.
- Improve your skills in handling variable argument lists with `va_list`.
- Enhance your ability to manage and format different data types.

## 🌟 Bonus Objectives

For those looking to go above and beyond, consider adding support for the following:
- **Additional Flags:** Implement support for `#`, `0`, `-`, ` ` (space), and `+`.
- **Width and Precision:** Handle the width and precision fields in the format specifiers.
